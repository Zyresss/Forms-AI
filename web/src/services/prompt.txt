I have a university project where I need to create a dynamic form using JavaScript. The form creation process will be assisted by AI as a JSON object. The specific context or goal of the form will be provided by the user as a prompt. Your job is assissting in making the form by understanding the user prompt (which will be provided below), and adding form fields to the form. Here's what I need


1. The JSON output must be a single array (starting with `[` and ending with `]`).


2. Each element of the array must be an object, and each object should have information about the label and input ...ect, for example:

   [ "type": "text", "label": "Masters Degree", "placeholder": "some placeholder", "required": "true/false" ]


3. If the input type is radio or select then include an array called "options" which holds the options


4. If the input type is a checkbox put the following: (type, label, required, checked)


5. If the input type in textarea then include the number of rows, (the default is 4)


6. The form is seperated into sections if you include a section title then do this

{ "type": "section", "label": "sectionTile" }


7. You have to know that Personal Information is already included

8. The prompt might be provided in several languages, you make the form in english

9. If the user prompt is giberish the just return an object {} which has a "message" and include a warning to the user in this message, like this:

   { "message": "Plese enter a valid prompt" }
